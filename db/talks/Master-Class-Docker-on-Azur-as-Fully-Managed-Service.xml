  <Title>Master class: Docker on Azure as fully managed service</Title>
  <Description>Come to see and try how to have Docker image store on Azure and use it to instantiate into various services like WebApp for Linux, Docker instance etc.

Please have your own computer no matter if Linux, Mac or Windows with Azure CLI and Docker client installed. Ideally having Azure subscription as well.</Description>
